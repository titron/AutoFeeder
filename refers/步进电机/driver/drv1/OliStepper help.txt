OliStepper.h V 1.1

Library for controlling
28BYJ-48 stepper motorS
with a ULN2003APG driver
Created by Olivier Friker, September 04, 2016.
released into the public domain, for the best and the worst.
Using multiple motors is possible (tested with 2).

______________________________________________
* Mandatory functions *

  Olistepper stepper1 (pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4, SPR)
	this creates an instance of the motor
	this line must be placed before the setup()
	define tha actual control pins you connected the driver to
	SPR is the number of steps per revolution (default 512)

  oliRun ()
	just put this function in your main loop()

______________________________________________
* available funtcions *

  setRPM(rpm)
	sets the speed in revolution per minute (default is 14)
	experimente what your motor can stand 

  setDirection(direction)
	use "CW" (which is default) or "CCW" to change direction
	use "STOP" to... well... stop the motor

  setAngle (angle)
	will move the motor once by the defined angle
	don't use negative numbers - to change the direction, use setDirection()
	set the angle to 0 to cancel this function

  setSteps (nbsteps)
	will move the motor once by the defined number of steps
	don't use negative numbers - to change the direction, use setDirection()
	set the number of stepsto 0 to cancel this function

  returnToOrigin ()
	will move the motor in opposite direction
	will stop the motor as soon as it reached the origin (or the zero position)
	the origin is the position when the program initialized unless it's been reset with setOrigin()

  rewindFully ()
	will move the motor in opposite direction
	will fully rezind the motor to the origin (or the zero position), which could mean multiple turns
	the origin is the position when the program initialized unless it's been reset with setOrigin()

  setOrigin()
	sets the origin at the current position


______________________________________________
* Example *

here's an example that starts both motors, one CW, one CCW, and stop only one after some time

---------------------------------------------------------
#include <OliStepper.h>

unsigned long deb;
OliStepper moteur1(8, 9, 10, 11, 512);
OliStepper moteur2(4, 5, 6, 7, 512);

void setup() {
  moteur1.setDirection ("CW");
  moteur1.setDirection ("CCW");
  deb = millis();
}


void loop() {
  unsigned long duree = millis()- deb;
  if (duree > 5000) {
    moteur1.setDirection ("STOP");
  }
moteur1.oliRun ();
moteur2.oliRun ();
}
